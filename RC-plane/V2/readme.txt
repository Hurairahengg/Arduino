Hello!
After my first version or prototype of the plane body, I finally decided to motorize it with a 1000 kV BLDC motor. But unfortunately, it didn't fly for several reasons; first of all, I didn't have a top cover for the body. Next, I didnt have a proper control system; it only had a motor to go forward, and I physically put the elevator up for it to fly. It could have flid only up in one direction if I closed the top with something. The top part sucked all the air inside the body, which didn't let it lift up. Also, unfortunately, I didnt get a video of it or the actual code used. I wrote the code in an unsaved file and then lost it. Overall, this version wasn't that groundbreaking, but I still learned some things from it.


Thank you for taking the time to read, bye!
