Hello!
Around July 15â€“20, 2023, I had planned to construct an RC airplane using carboards and an Arduino. I made a total of - versions. The first few were just the body and the motor put together and controlled with Arduino and Bluetooth. Those could really go left, right, or something. Those could not even be set to normal speeds, only specific speeds. The next version had a remote control since I got the radio module. It was really good overall, and you can read about all the versions in the versions readme.


Thank you for taking the time to read, bye!
