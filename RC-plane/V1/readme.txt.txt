Hello!
During my summer vacation around July 15â€“20, 2023, I constructed the first iteration of the plane body. I had to plan a body, study the aerodynamics of how it operates, and then construct it all in around 10 days. Due to the necessity of a first layer of paper and a middle layer of foam, the wing took me a while to complete. Finding it in a Daiso store close to my house required a lot of searching on my part. The video shows that it had the ability to fly up and be stable.


Thank you for taking the time to read, bye!
