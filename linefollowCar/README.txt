This is an Arduino line following a car I made a little while ago. The strength of this car was not sufficient and it was not functioning properly. The causes of those problems are as follows:
1: I got a new 3D printer so I wasn't sure how to properly design 3D models for my car.
I was only using a cheap white and black color detector. If I had at least two, it would have been better.
Since there was only one sensor was installed on the car, as you can see in the video. It wasn't the best project I did, but it's something cool for me to begin with.

Thank you for taking the time to read, bye!
